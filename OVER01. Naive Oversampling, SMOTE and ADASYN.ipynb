    "# Imbalanced classes in a dataset can skew model boundaries (e.g. SVC, SVR) to favour the majority class\n",
    "# There is a need to oversample the minority class (e.g. if only 0.5% of response is 1 and 99.5% is 0)\n",
    "# Can do naive sampling of 1s by repeating them in dataset until they end up 50-50% for 0s and 1s\n",
    "# By giving the 1s more \"say\" through more points, their error cannot be neglected and model will prioritize them more\n",
    "# This is similar to using a unique RMSE or accuracy metric that weights the 1 more heavily by a ratio of beta = no of 0/no of 1s\n",
    "# However some models might work differently for error weighing metric vs naive sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "# Besides random naive sampling, there's always cool methods of making synthetic data\n",
    "\n",
    "# SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique\n",
    "# For each rare datapoint of the minority, SMOTE finds the nearest neighbors\n",
    "# Drawing a line (or line traversing multi dimensions) between the current point and nearest neighbor, a new point is created on that imaginary point\n",
    "# It is a kind of interpolation that gets the middle ground between the points\n",
    "# e.g. a=0, b=1, c=2, y=1 (+ve rare response) is found to have nearest neighbor of a=0.2, b=-3, c=2, y=1 (+ve response)\n",
    "# Nearest neighbor is found using RMS distance of features a,b,c and y is both of 1\n",
    "# Then a possible new SMOTE point is a=0.1, b=0, c=2 - notice how the points lie on the 3D line between the two points \n",
    "# Advantage of SMOTE: Synthetic observations are less likely to overfit than repeating data through naive samples\n",
    "# While no data loss is present if you do oversampling of 1s (and not undersample the 0s to a small number), there is no new info\n",
    "# SMOTE creates new info with the assumption that future 1s would have similar features like the 0s\n",
    "# However if 1 data points are too little, data quality bad or interpolation not realistic due to circumstances, then model might not work on future data\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) - alternative to SMOTE\n",
    "# While SMOTE is good in creating synthetic points, it tends to create points in between current points\n",
    "# Hence the density of points will end up concentrated inside the widest permimeter of the area (or hyperdimensional volume)\n",
    "# e.g. if you have a sphere of points of coordinates (a,b,c), all lines will be in the sphere or near its surface\n",
    "# Hence the points spawned on the line will not be concentrated on border regions with the 0s where a clear distinction is important for models\n",
    "# A better info metric might be to create points with priority at CHALLENGING region of 1s and 0s \n",
    "# Some regions might only have a few 1s and so it needs help to seperate the points more clearly by putting more 1s in neighborhood\n",
    "# This may work very well for boundary based models like SVC, or random forest\n",
    "\n",
    "# First, ADASYN finds the ratio b of 0s vs 1s. If 0 is 10 times of 1, then b=10\n",
    "# G = (ml-ms)*b, where G is total number of synthetic points to create and ms and ml are weights to be set?\n",
    "# Next, ADASYN finds k nearest neighbors, e.g. if there are 5 neighbors near the current 1 point, k=5\n",
    "# Out of the k neighbors, the number of points that are 0s (the majority class) will be determined\n",
    "# A ri value is calculated based on (no. of majority points in k neighbors)/no. of k neighbors\n",
    "# e.g. if there are 5 neighbors and 3 are 0s (majority class), ri = 3/5\n",
    "# Each point of response 1 will be looped through to find k neighbors and ri value\n",
    "# The higher rᵢ, the more dominant the majority class and the more difficult the neighborhood for that point is to learn for your classifier.\n",
    "# ADASYN normalizes the r values for all minority observations so that their sum is one.\n",
    "# ADASYN computes the number of synthetic observations to generate in each neighborhood, i.e. Gi = G*ri\n",
    "# where G is total number to be made, ri is ratio for the neighborhood of point i, Gi is num of points for the neighborhood\n",
    "# For each point that still has a rare (response 1) neighbor nearby, the usual linear interpolation is done\n",
    "# si = xi + (xzi - xi) * lambda, where lambda is random factor from 0 to 1, xi is current point, xzi is neighbor and si is new point\n",
    "# Alternatively, we can mark out a plane from 3 points (of response 1) and create a point any point on that plane\n",
    "\n",
    "# As with most algorithms, there are several extensions of SMOTE. \n",
    "# These aim to improve SMOTE by adding to its functionality or lessening its weaknesses.\n",
    "# Extension of SMOTE: (examples)\n",
    "# BorderlineSMOTE: Instead of oversampling between all minority observations, BorderlineSMOTE aims to increase the number of minority observations that border majority observations. \n",
    "# The goal here is to allow the classifier to be able to distinguish between these borderline observations more clearly.\n",
    "# ADASYN focuses more on challenging areas with little 1s, which need not be the boundaries. But BorderlineSMOTE is more border based\n",
    "# SVMSMOTE: SVMSMOTE, as its name implies, utilizes the Support Vector Machine algorithm to generate new minority observations close to the border between the majority and minority classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Different algos have different ways of generating the points"
